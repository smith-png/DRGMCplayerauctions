# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the DRGMCplayerauctions React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.0.16)
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new dependency tree

### 2. Code Modifications

#### Modified: `src/App.jsx`
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to the main App component
- The component is placed at the root level within the `<AuthProvider>`, ensuring it tracks performance across all routes

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the official Vercel Speed Insights documentation for React applications:
- Used the `/react` import path which is appropriate for Create React App and Vite-based React applications
- The component is placed at the application root level to ensure performance tracking across all pages
- No additional configuration was needed as the component works out of the box

## Build Verification

- Successfully built the application using `npm run build`
- No errors or warnings related to the Speed Insights integration
- Build output shows all assets compiled correctly

## Next Steps

To complete the Speed Insights setup:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Once deployed, the Speed Insights script will be available at `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
4. Visit the Speed Insights tab in the Vercel dashboard to view performance metrics

## Technical Notes

- The SpeedInsights component automatically detects the current route in React applications
- No manual route tracking is required for React Router
- The component is lightweight and does not impact application performance
- Data collection only begins after deployment to Vercel with Speed Insights enabled
